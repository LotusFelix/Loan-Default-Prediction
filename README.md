# Loan-Default-Prediction
Loan default prediction using Home Credit Data

This project investigates the factors that contribute to loan defaults, with a particular focus on individuals often labeled as "credit invisible" â€” those with little or no credit history. 

Inspired by the challenges faced by over five million British citizens who are unable to access mainstream financial services due to poor or non-existent credit histories (Experian 2022), the project aims to identify and simplify predictive models that lenders could use.

Leveraging the Home Credit Default Risk dataset from Kaggle, we analyze key features to determine the likelihood of loan applicants defaulting on their loans. This dataset provides anonymized data from Home Credit, allowing us to perform exploratory data analysis and model feature correlation. Our objective is to determine whether removing certain controversial or less significant features, such as postcode-based assessments, can still yield accurate predictive results.

By the end of this project, we explore simplified machine learning models that can enhance fairness in loan assessments without sacrificing predictive accuracy. The code and analysis can serve as a valuable resource for machine learning enthusiasts and professionals working in financial risk assessment.
